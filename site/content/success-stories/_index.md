    quote: "We wanted to test out something we were unsure about implementing, and the monitoring of each team member gave us the evidence we needed to make an informed decision. The benefits are obvious in terms of mental health and wellbeing. There's been a bigger sense of happiness in our work environment and no more 'Sunday night feeling'."

    company: "BRILLIANT NOISE"
    quote: "We value experimentation, and the fact we were working with the University meant that this was being monitored properly. The benefits have been flexibility, trust in one another, and serious conversations about realism at work – but the strongest result has been the increased positivity of staff and belief in the company's values. It's testament to how well it has gone that no one can imagine going back!"

    quote: "Working with the University has given us a framework for how to approach the trial, and Charlotte made very helpful suggestions on how we could get the system to work. It legitimises the test of the 4 day week in my shareholders' minds. Personally I love the empirical evidence that has been gained to back up the benefits of the trial period. People are happier, and sickness has dropped significantly."

    company: "SOCIAL FOR GOOD"
    quote: "The University gives credibility to organisations trialing this; if any of our clients were sceptical, that ended when we told them about the trial. It's been a very positive experience - we've continued to perform well financially and with happy clients. Team members have committed to more exercise and creative pursuits, and no-one has complained of feeling stressed or run down."

    quote: "As our business is about exploring new ideas in the world of work, we were intrigued and wanted to try out the 4 day week so we could recommend it to clients. Charlotte's insights were helpful, particularly the reassurance that it would take a while to settle into it. As founders, we find it difficult to step away from the business – we had to keep boundaries and not feel guilty about it, and we have definitely been more productive on the other four days as a result."

    company: "SUSSEX INNOVATION"
    quote: "Our brand is about innovation, embracing new ideas and practices. The 4 day week is one of the biggest shifts happening in the world of work right now, and we want to be able to speak with authority to our members about how they can make it work. The only way we can do that is by experimenting with it ourselves."

    company: "ADVICE CLOUD"
    quote: "The idea had been on the table for some time, but it was the University trial that gave us the push we needed to give it a go. Knowing that it would be done 'properly' and that we had access to knowledgeable people along the way gave us the confidence we needed. There's been a positive impact on morale, engagement and innovative thinking."

    quote: "We really like it - everyone seems happier, and mental health has improved. It's helped us retain staff, attract talent, and we're more focused. The trial was a good transition to making it happen - not sure it would have happened yet without us working with you."

    quote: "Without the support of the University I very much doubt that we'd have embarked on the 4 day week trial. It definitely gave us the confidence to run a trial, and it's been great to receive a report at the end of the trial to see the impact the trial has had, without it being based entirely on feel."
