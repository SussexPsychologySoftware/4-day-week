  description: "We help employers to trial a shorter working week, and measure the effects on staff wellbeing and work experience. 
      If you’re not yet ready for a shorter working week, the programme also offers the option to take part in productivity training and research without a change to working hours, as a ‘control’ employer.
      Your organisation can be based anywhere in the UK, and doesn't need to be local to Sussex.
      Complete our form below, and we'll send further information about our employer support programme."
